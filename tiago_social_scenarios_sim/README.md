# tiago_social_scenarios_sim

Package that provides scenario nodes. Scenario nodes orchestrate operation of robot and people in social robotic experiments (see `tiago_social_experiments_sim` package). Dynamic people are usually introduced using [`HuBeRo` framework](https://github.com/rayvburn/hubero).

## Scenario nodes

- `lab_012_dynamic_hubero` corresponds to the dynamic scenario during evaluating different local trajectory planners using the [`SRPB` benchmark](https://github.com/rayvburn/srpb),
- `aws_hospital_normal_hubero` general development scenario for the customized [AWS RoboMaker Hospital](https://github.com/rayvburn/aws-robomaker-hospital-world) world.
